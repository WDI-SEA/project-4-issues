# PROJECT 4 ISSUES!

If you're having trouble with your project, open an issue on this repository, and follow the template to leave a detailed comment about your issue, an instructor will respond to you, and attempt to give you all the help you need! If your problem can't be resolved in a timely fashion through issue replies, we'll jump into a breakout room and guide you on resolving the problem.
